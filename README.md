# gagchain (Gagcoin)

Experimental blockchain built in Golang. It is still under development and features will be updated regulary.

## Features

- Custom TCP server for communication with nodes
- Custom Database built only to store the current chain
- Custom communication messages to communicate with other nodes
- Built to only communicate to one trusted node, and that node has another trusted node. This cycle continues
- Easy to compile and run

## Using this for your own blockchain project

If you use this as a template, please do not remove any credits, and I expect to be credited in a README file or something similar. You can always run your own node, just setup the variables that are found in the `main.go` file (root directory).
